    <h2>Ian Toone</h2>
    <p>My name is Ian and I am from Pocatello, Idaho. I currently live in Northwest Arkansas with my wife, Ashley, and
        my (almost) three-year-old daughter, Tinsley. I like mountain biking, camping, hiking, graphic design, and playing the ukulele. My wife and I have been married for five years and have
        been members of the Church our entire lives.</p>
    <p>I am pursuing a degree in Business Management and have one more semester after this one. I'm taking this class becasue web design is something I've always liked. I work as a
        merchandising & compliance manager at Sam's Club in Fort Smith, Arkansas and I am interested in pursuing a
        career in ethics and compliance with Sam's Club and Walmart at their Home Office facilities in Bentonville,
        Arkansas.</p>
