            <h2>This is Idaho</h2>
            <p>Brands identify people and people identify the meaning of a brand. What does it mean to be identified with a particular brand?
                People all over the world use brands as a way to show their loyalties, identities, likeness, and hobbies.
                What I want to do is to give the people of Idaho a way to show their love and loyalty to a great state, to adventure, to the wild.
                Shirts, stickers, and hats allow people to easily identify what they love: Idaho.
                Poke & Oak is a long-known location term used in Pocatello to identify the old "center of the city."
                We chose this name because it shows a centralized desire to build around a central concept, the love of Idaho.
                It is our hope that you will accompany us on our journey to be more... wild!
      
              <p>
                 We are a clothing company whom aspires to be more than that.
                 We want to be an inspiration for people around us so that each of them can inspire change.
                 What first began in Hawaii as an idea blossomed into more than an idea.
                 I would see sticker after sticker from all types of surf shops and specialty stores that it sparked something inside of me.
                 I wanted to make a brand that people wave around like a flag.
                 I wanted to make a brand that people would use to make a statement.
                 I wanted to make a brand that could live synonymously with concepts and ideas and that could form into something even more than that.
                 These ideas formed into Poky Idaho brands in Pocatello, Idaho (which is where these images are from).
                 This once existed as an idea for a creative outlet, which it still is, but now it offers something a little bit different.
                 We feel the brand has grown to encompass a sense of charity, which will be expounded upon in the next few pages. </p>
