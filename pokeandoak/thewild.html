            <h2>Efforts</h2>
              <p>The natural beauty around us speaks volumes without saying a word.
                We've grown up in Idaho and continue to enjoy the mountains, valleys, sun, and snow around us.
                We want to continue advances to protect the world around us by first starting in Idaho.
                All of our shirts are made from sustainable materials and will last years to come.
                Five percent of sales go toward Idaho Forest Restoration Partnership so that we can help plant a better future.
                We also have a sister company: The Bold Bear brands based in Northwest Arkansas.
                They use a similar method to inspire social and environmental change.
